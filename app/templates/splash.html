<h3>A better way to find your classmates!</h3>
<p>Yalies is a website (mobile app coming soon!) that provides data on the Yale student body. It combines data from <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Yale Face Book</a>, <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Yale Directory</a>, and other sources, and contributes additional analysis to provide as much useful information as possible.</p>
<p>Of interest to developers, and unlike official Yale data sources, Yalies also provides a powerful and flexible API to make fetching student info a breeze. No need to parse the Yale Face Book HTML for your projects.</p>
<p>For questions, comments, bug reports, or suggestions, contact <a href="mailto:erik.boesen@yale.edu">erik.boesen@yale.edu</a>.</p>
