<h3>A better directory of your classmates!</h3>
<p>Yalies is a website (mobile app coming soon) that provides information on the Yale student body. It displays the data that is shown on the <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Yale Face Book</a> and <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Yale Directory</a>, with improved design, user interface, and security.</p>
<!--
<p>Of interest to developers, and unlike official Yale data sources, Yalies also provides a powerful and flexible API to make fetching student info a breeze. No need to parse the Yale Face Book HTML for your projects.</p>
<p>Our API has been used by <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/12/03/40-2-percent-of-returning-student-athletes-take-leaves-of-absence-this-fall">Yale Daily News, students in S&DS 315 and CPSC 490, and by student projects like <a href="https://coursetable.com">CourseTable</a>, <a href="https://ypost.app">YPost</a>, <a href="https://ship.wtf">Ship</a>, and more.</p>
