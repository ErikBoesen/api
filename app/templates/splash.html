<h3>Learn about your classmates!</h3>
<p><strong>Yalies</strong> is a website and mobile app (WIP) that helps you obtain data on the Yale student body. It regularly aggregates and cleans data from multiple sources, including the <a href="https://students.yale.edu/facebook">Yale Face Book</a> and <a href="https://directory.yale.edu">Directory</a>, in order to provide the most useful information possible.</p>
<p>Unlike any existing Yale student information services, <strong>Yalies</strong> also provides a powerful and flexible API to make fetching student data a breeze. HTML parsing the Yale Face Book can become a thing of the past. Obtain an API token by logging in.</p>
